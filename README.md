## Usage

1. **User Registration**: Customers can sign up and log in.
2. **Service Management**: Admins can add and manage services through the admin dashboard.
3. **Booking**: Customers can view available services and book appointments.
4. **Profile Management**: Users can update their information and view booking history.

## Scalability Considerations

1. **Database Design**: The current database schema is designed to support a growing number of users and services. Additional indexes can be added as necessary to optimize performance.
2. **Microservices Architecture**: As the application grows, consider migrating to a microservices architecture to handle different functionalities independently (e.g., authentication, booking, notifications).
3. **Caching**: Implement caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to enhance performance and reduce database load, especially for frequently accessed data like service listings.
4. **Load Balancing**: As user traffic increases, consider deploying the application with load balancers to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple server instances.
5. **Containerization**: Use Docker to containerize the application, making it easier to manage dependencies and scale deployments.
